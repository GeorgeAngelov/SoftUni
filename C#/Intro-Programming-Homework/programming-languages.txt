									Programming languages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1.Python is the most popular programming language for 2014.
Python is better in readability and C# has more consistent syntax.
Python is better in cross platform development and in ease of learning, where as
C# is winner in standard library, language features, development process and tools,
and performance.

	2.Java - the second most popular programming language for 2014 does not allow 
operator overloading and C# does. Java has primitive types as int, char, double and etc.
Both have strict compiler conditions and excellent exception handling.

	3.C++ is third in usage.C++ creates raw assemblies that run directly on the target platform and
C# is a managed language that runs in a virtual machine, compiles down to a platform agnostic intermediate code.
C# does not support multiple inheritance, C++ does.C# assemblies contain metadata about the code, 
allowing for runtime inspection.C++ does not contain this metadata.

	4.Ruby - Like C#, Ruby is a pure object-oriented language; in both languages, everything is an object. 
Both languages use exception handling to notify errors, allow object introspection,
both have automatic memory management through garbage collection and allow the creation of multithreaded applications.
They are also very “hyped” languages, which have a huge level of support in the industry, by different vendors and communities.

	5.JavaScript - JavaScript is a Scripting language executed by a browser, where as c# is full fleged language executed by .net framework.
It could be used with any web tech, like PHP,ASP,ASP.net etc. JS  is used mainly for client side validations, 
where as c# handles for your core business logics,mainly interacting to database.
It  can be embedded into HTML,.asp,.aspx pages or an individual .js file could be created, whereas c# code  always creates a .cs file .
